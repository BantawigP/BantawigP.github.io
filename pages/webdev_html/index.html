    <p>This is an example of html activity</p>
        <p><a href="https://BantawigP.github.io/pages/webdev_html/Fashion_Blog.html">Fashion Blog</a></p>
        <p>This CSS activity allowed me to learn how to use classes, IDs, and attributes as selectors, enabling me to modify the color, size, spacing, and overall look and feel of the website. The common problem I always encountered in this activity was the proper use of selectors when you want to use them. As I completed it, I learned that CSS is what truly attracts people to your website.</p>

        <p>In the second HTML activity, I had the opportunity to create a table to showcase a schedule of events. This taught me how to construct tables, define table headers, and arrange rows and columns within a table. I also learned about the `<colspan>` attribute and the semantics of `<thead>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`. I faced challenges related to the correct placement of closing tags and syntax errors. This activity emphasized the importance of maintaining proper syntax while demonstrating that tables, though seemingly straightforward, can become quite complex. Overall, it was a valuable lesson in observing correct coding practices.</p>
