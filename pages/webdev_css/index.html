    <p>This is an example of CSS activity</p>
        <p><a href="https://BantawigP.github.io/pages/webdev_css/burger.html">Fashion Blog</a></p>
        <p>This CSS activity allowed me to learn how to use classes, IDs, and attributes as selectors, enabling me to modify the color, size, spacing, and overall look and feel of the website. The common problem I always encountered in this activity was the proper use of selectors when you want to use them. As I completed it, I learned that CSS is what truly attracts people to your website.</p>
